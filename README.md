# SlippyCheeze's Read It Once

This simple addon reduces the interaction required to read books throughout
the world.  When you encounter a book you have previously seen, it will
display an alert informing you of that, rather than opening the book
for reading.

The very first time you encounter a book, however, it will be shown as normal.

This is an account-wide addon, so any book seen on any character will count as
"read".  You should, however, still receive full credit for skill
points regardless.
